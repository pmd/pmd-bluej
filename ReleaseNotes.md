# pmd-bluej Release Notes

## 08-June-2015 - 2.0.0

* pmd-bluej extension uses now a PMD installed on the local pc
* This allows you to use the latest PMD version (e.g. 5.3.2)

### Installation

The prior version of this extension from 2001 included PMD, so to use it, PMD
did not have to be installed.  This version of this extension does not include PMD
so you must install PMD under your operating system of choice and you must get it
operating at the command line.

There are two versions of the extension:

1. `PMDExecExt.jar` for Linux
2. `PMDExecExt-win.jar` for Windows

See <https://github.com/pmd/pmd-bluej/blob/master/README.md> for more information.
